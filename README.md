# Full Cycle Course - Advanced Patterns and Techniques with Git and Github - Git Challenge

## Introduction
This is my resolution to a practice challenge of the [Full Cycle course by code.education](https://fullcycle.com.br/). This course aims to teach developers to become a [Full Cycle Developer](https://netflixtechblog.com/full-cycle-developers-at-netflix-a08c31f83249), a concept introduced by Netflix.
